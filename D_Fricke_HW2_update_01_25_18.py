#In this homework,the ultimate goal is to create a function called areaofatriangle,
#which takes six parameters which represent three intersecting lines
#of the form y = (m * x) + b that mark the three sides of the triangle.

#In order to accomplish this you will need functions which determine
#where two lines intersect (x and y), a function which determines the distance between
#two points represented by (x,y) coordinates, and a function which determines
#the area of a triangle using three side lengths(using Heron's Formula).

#Please complete the four required functions below:

import math # This line allows you to use math functions. Importantly, math.sqrt(#),
            # which will produce the square root of the number inside the parentheses.

    # Calculate x for the point where two equations:
    # y = (m1 * x) + b1 and y = (m2 * x) + b2 intersect.
    #replace this with your calculation for x

    x = (b2 - b1)/(m1 - m2)
    return x

def intersectionoftwolines_y(m1, b1, m2, b2):
    # Calculate y for the point where two equations:
    # y = (m1 * x) + b1 and y = (m2 * x) + b2 intersect.
    #replace this with your calculation for y

    x = intersectionoftwolines_x(m1, b1, m2, b2)
    y = m1*x + b1

    b = ((x2_distance)**2 + (y2_distance)**2)**(1/2)
    c = ((x3_distance)**2 + (y3_distance)**2)**(1/2)
    area = heronsformula(a, b, c)

    #Using the three functions above, now calculate the area of a
    #triangle when the three sides are described by three linear equations
    #y = (m1 * x) + b1;  y = (m2 * x) + b2; and y = (m3 * x) + b3
